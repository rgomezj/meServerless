![](/img/zhaohuabing.png)  Hi, my name is **Roger Gomez**. I am a Software developer who enjoys analyzing and proposing solutions to business problems.
I have solid experience in Microsoft Technologies, but consider myself a fast learner when it comes to interact with other platforms and languages.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to a wide variety of projects, specially in the roles of Software Developer and Technical Lead.
I am also co-organizer of MDE.Net (http://mdedotnet.co), the community for .Net developers in Medellin-Colombia, in which I have given some talks related with Web technologies.

I enjoy the fact our industry moves fast enough that force us to always be learning something new. At the same time I am convinced that is not knowing 
"trendy" technologies what make us great professionals, but being able to apply our agnostic knowledge to build effective solutions that make people happy!

I am interested in Serverless technologies and how they could be used to empower people to have web presence

I hold a master degree in Software Developement from Eatift University, which is located in Medellin-Colombia.

Currently, I work as Technical Lead for a team that delivers solutions using the Dynamics CRM platform. I also work as Freelance developer
in different kind of projects through Upwork platform (https://www.upwork.com), in which I have had the fortune of working with great clients for more than **2000 hours** (see my profile here https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01cf02d33ccbefd80b)

While I am not working, I enjoy sharing with Family and Friends, playing guitar, going to concerts (specially Heavy metal :D), and playing video games (this has been less frequent over time).
